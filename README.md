PERSONALITY PREDICTION SYSTEM VIA CV ANALYSIS

Description:

This project is a Python-based Personality Prediction System that uses Computer Vision (CV) analysis techniques to predict personality traits based on data stored in a CSV file. It leverages machine learning and image processing to provide insights into an individual's personality based on facial expressions and other visual cues.

Installation:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies.

Usage:

1. Run the main Python script to start the application.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the CSV file containing the necessary data for analysis.
3. The system will process the data, perform CV analysis, and provide personality predictions.

Data Preparation:

1. Ensure your CSV file contains the following columns:
- Column 1: Image file paths or URLs
- Column 2: Personality trait labels or categories
2. Additional columns as needed for other features
3. Organize your data and ensure it's clean and well-structured.

Model Training:

Provide information on how the machine learning model was trained, including hyperparameters, data splitting, and model evaluation metrics.

Inference:

Describe the process of making predictions using the trained model and how users can interpret the results.
